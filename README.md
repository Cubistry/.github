# 🧩 Cubistry

**Cubistry** is an advanced R&D organization focused on building intelligent simulation environments and AI neural networks.  
Our mission is to push the boundaries of 3D simulation, machine learning, and autonomous problem-solving systems.

## 🚀 What We Do

- 🎲 Develop high-precision simulation platforms for training AI models
- 🧠 Build custom neural networks specialized in cube-solving and spatial reasoning
- 🛠️ Design modular, scalable systems for simulation-to-AI data pipelines
- 🔬 Focus on research, innovation, and technical excellence

## 🛤️ Our Projects

- [Cubistry Sim](https://github.com/cubistry/cubistry-sim) — A lightweight, high-accuracy 3D Rubik’s Cube simulation engine designed to generate training data for AI models.
- [Cubistry AI](https://github.com/cubistry/cubistry-ai) — Proprietary neural network models trained using simulated cube states for autonomous solving and learning tasks.
- [Cubistry Core](https://github.com/cubistry/cubistry-core) — Foundational libraries supporting simulation management, dataset generation, and AI training pipelines.

> 🧠 Simulation first. Intelligence next.
